## About

This is a moon phase chart I built to help me plan out astro-imaging nights. It provides the moon phase, moon rise and set time, and the astro dark start and end time. This is useful so you can see how much of the night is moon-free.

It will get your location, or you can enter manually, and you select the dates, and it will calculate for that month.

## Credits

I pretty much just copied the code from [this site](http://hinch.me.uk/riset.html#twig03a) to perform the calculations for the site.
